        <h3>So why make a fictional language?</h3>
        <p>
            As this article discusses, fictional languages are difficult to learn, can't be engineered for a particular purpose, and are largely divorced from reälity.
            This might lead one to wonder what the point of making a fictional language is, anyway.
        <p>
            The purpose of a fictional language is the same as the purpose of fiction generally, and I leave this answer for the reader to discover themselves.

            <h2>Fictional languages</h2>
            <p>
                The goal of <u>the LANGDEV Project</u> is to aid in the generation of fictional languages.
                This, of course, might lead one to wonder:
                What <em>is</em> a fictional language?
                The definition which we use is as follows.
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    A <dfn>fictional language</dfn> is an invented language whose origins exist outside the tangible realm.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                It is immediately obvious that not every language which appears in fiction is a fictional language; <u>English</u> appears very often, for example, in fiction, but its origins are quite traceäble through the modern sciënces of linguistics, anthropology, and archæology.
                But neither would a language which sprung up out of thin air (or an author's imagination) necessarily be fictional; a language must <em>have</em> an origin for that origin to be something other than fact.
            <p>
                Because of this, although fictional languages and constructed languages (conlangs) are both <em>invented</em> languages—both are a product of human invention—the two categories tend towards non-interesecting sets with profoundly differing properties.
                To better clarify what the definition of a fictional language entails, an discussion of a few important differences follows.<sup><a id="n1" href="#f1">1</a></sup>
            <dl>
                <dt>Conlangs are <em>constructed</em>, fictional languages are <em>generated</em>.
                <dd>
                    <p>
                        The word <i>constructed</i> implies a number of things.
                        Construction suggests an architect, and furthermore, <em>architecture</em>; a constructed language might be designed by someone to be easy to learn, or to be unambiguous to understand, or to test a philosophical concept, or to have a certain sound.
                        The act of construction is, after all, the manifestation of an ideä into reälity.
                    <p>
                        Fictional languages have no author, constructor, or creätor in the real world.
                        Their genesis is not a plan which is executed, nor an ideä which is made manifest, for such a situation would place their origin firmly within the confines of the real.
                        Rather, fictional languages are <em>generated</em>, over centuries or millenia of cultural and historical development—the fact that these developments are <em>fictional</em> does not reduce their linguistic impact.
                        It would not be possible to make a fictional language which is grammatically unambiguous or easy to learn, because encoded into each one is thousands of years of cultural difference aliën to any speaker on this planet.
                <dt>Conlangs are <em>ahistorical</em>, fictional languages are <em>historical</em>.
                <dd>
                    <p>
                        The purpose of a conlang is to construct a language which history has not otherwise provided, oftentimes because the nature of the language is something which history would not naturally be likely to develop.
                        Consequently, although conlangs are of course historically situated, and doubtlessly grow and develop after their original inception, the project of conlanging is a fundamentally <em>ahistorical</em> project.
                    <p>
                        The project of a fictional language is quite the opposite:
                        It is to produce a language <em>with</em> a history, culturally, etymologically, and otherwise, which <em>has</em> developed naturally—only according to the nature of a fictional environment.
                        This makes them <em>historical</em>, and we can talk about them historically the same as we could any natural language.

                    Of course, the following points make massive generalizations, both about conlangs and the nature of fictional languages.
                    They are for illustration purposes only.

		<h3><u>7c</u> dictionaries</h3>

			These dictionaries require a browser with <abbr title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> support, as well as support for <abbr title="eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations">XSLT</abbr> 1.0.
			Most modern browsers support these features.

			<h2><u>The 7c Languages</u></h2>
			<p>
				<u>The LANGDEV Project</u> <a href="/about/history/" title="A Brief History of LANGDEV">began</a> circa <time datetime="2009">2009</time> with the very specific intent of building a set of etymologically-independent language for use with a story project, codenamed <cite>7c</cite>.
				In total, three language families were produced from this initial effort.
				These language families, described below, are now considered <a href="/about/canonicality/">non-canonical</a> by <u>the LANGDEV Project</u>, but were used as the basis for <u>Classical Sevensi</u>, currently in development.
			<p>
				The language families included within <u>the 7c languages</u> are:
			<ul>
				<li> <a href="http://langdev.xyz/jsv/lrx/dict.xml">Lrex</a>
				<li> <a href="http://langdev.xyz/jsv/eho/dict.xml">Eho</a>
				<li> <a href="http://langdev.xyz/jsv/jtl/dict.xml">Jastulae</a>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The names of <u>Eho</u> and <u>Lrex</u> are derived from geographic regions in the <cite>7c</cite> world:
				<i>Lrex</i> is an abbreviated kingdom name, <i>Eho</i> is a shortening of <i><abbr title="East">E.</abbr> Hope</i> (referring to the <u>Hopèän</u> continent).
				Similarly, the use of <i>□</i> as an abbreviation for <i><u>Eho</u></i> and of <i>⊻</i> as an abbreviation for <i><u>Jastulae</u></i> derives from <cite>7c</cite> symbology.
			<aside>
				<p>
					Note:
					Although <u>the 7c languages</u> have their origins in the <cite>7c</cite> story project, the two are no longer considered closely related, and the descendant <u>Sevensi</u> language is quite distinct.
			</aside>
			<p>
				In <time datetime="2012">2012</time>, the <u>Jastugay</u> language was developed as a revised version of <u>Jastulae</u> with formally designed grammars and a syllabic writing system.
				Due to shortcomings in the original design of the language (in particular, a lack of diversity in the existing lexis), it was abandoned temporarily in <time datetime="2014">2014</time>.
				Then, in <time datetime="2015">2015</time>, all three <u>7c languages</u> (including the <u>Jastugay</u> revisions) were combined into a single <u>Proto–Jastu-Sevensi</u> language, from which <u>Sevensi</u> development began proper.
			<p>
				The most complete descriptions of <u>the 7c languages</u> can be found by following the links provided above.
				Links to scans of the original handwritten source documents are provided as part of each dictionary's source description.
				These dictionaries are provided as <abbr title="Text Encoding Initiative">TEI</abbr>+<abbr title="eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations">XSLT</abbr> documents as a means of allowing both straightforward readability and sophisticated processing; these technologies should be supported to an acceptable extent in most modern browsers.

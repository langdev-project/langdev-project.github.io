                This document is something of a working draft to keep track of the LREC format until such a time as it can be suitably generalized and well-defined.
                It is based off of the original never-completed LREC specification, which was abandoned <time datetime="2016-11-10">10 November 2016</time>.
                This document was last updated on <time datetime="2017-07-08">08 July 2017</time>.

            <h2>LexisML Index Records<br>1.0 Specification</h2>
            <section id="introduction">
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    The LexisML Index Record (LREC) serves to index the lexicon of a language and provide links to word definitions.
                    LRECs are designed to be minimalist text files that can store a large number of records in a compact, human-readable format.
                    The purpose of an LREC is to give users and programs a sense of the scope of a lexicon without having to read each individual entry, thus reducing initial load times for displaying an index thereof.
                <p>
                    The format of a LREC is based upon that of the IANA Language Subtag Registry, which is in turn derived from the record-jar format described in <a href="#art-unix"><cite class="plain">[ART-UNIX]</cite></a>.

                <h3>The LREC Format</h3>
                <p>
                    LRECs are plain-text files, encoded in UTF-8 as specified by <a href="#unicode"><cite class="plain">[UNICODE]</cite></a>.
                    They consist of a sequence of one or more <dfn>records</dfn>, each separated by the two-character sequence U+0025 PERCENT SIGN, U+0025 PERCENT SIGN on its own line.
                    Records, in turn, consist of several name-value pairs known as <dfn>fields</dfn>.
                <p>
                    A field <strong>MUST</strong> consist of the following, in order:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            A sequence of characters which does not include the sequence U+0020 SPACE, U+003A COLON, U+0020 SPACE.
                            These make up the field's <dfn>name</dfn>.
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The character sequence U+0020 SPACE, U+003A COLON, U+0020 SPACE.
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            A sequence of characters, at least one of which is a non-space character.
                            These make up the field's <dfn>value</dfn>.
                            Whitespace which begins or ends a field's value <strong>MUST</strong> be ignored.
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Lines <strong>MUST NOT</strong> be longer than 72 bytes; consequently, field values <strong>MAY</strong> need to be broken across multiple lines.
                    The contents of any lines which are begun by four U+0020 SPACE characters, starting with the fifth character of the line, <strong>MUST</strong> be considered a continuation of the preceding field's value.
                    Similarly, lines which do not begin with four U+0020 SPACE characters <strong>MUST NOT</strong> be considered a continuation of the preceding field's value.
                <p>
                    Lines whose contents are begun by exactly one (not two) U+0025 PERCENT SIGN character are comments and <strong>MUST</strong> be ignored.
                    An LREC <strong>MUST NOT</strong> contain lines which are not either part of a field, a comment, or the sequence U+0025 PERCENT SIGN, U+0025 PERCENT SIGN, U+000A LINE FEED.
                <p>
                    Fields are referred to by their names.
                    Except where otherwise specified, more than one field of a particular name <strong>MUST NOT</strong> appear in a single record.
                    All fields which are not marked as <i>OPTIONAL</i> or <i>RECOMMENDED</i> are <strong>REQUIRED</strong> to appear in a record's contents.
                    Except where otherwise specified, field names are case-insensitive but field values are case-sensitive.

                            Furthermore, both fields <strong>MUST</strong> be unique across an LDOC; that is, any two <code>tag</code> or <code>subgroup</code> fields in an LDOC <strong>MUST NOT</strong> have the same value when compared in a case-insensitive manner, regardless of the record they are contained in.

                            A lexeme record provides information on a lexeme.
                            It consists of the following fields, in any order, specified by name:

                                    The lexeme itself.
                                    This <strong>MUST</strong> be unique across an LDOC; ie, there must not be more than one lexeme record with a given lexeme field.

                            An inflection record provides inflected forms for lexemes.

                                    This MUST match the lexeme field of a lexeme record, which MUST appear before the given inflection record.

                            An alternate record provides alternate forms for lexemes or inflections.
                            It consists of the following fields, in any order, specified by their field names:

                                    The lexeme or inflection that the record provides an alternate for.
                                    This <strong>MUST</strong> match the lexeme field of a lexeme record or the inflected field of an inflection record, either of which <strong>MUST</strong> appear before the given alternate record.

                                    If the <code>for</code> field refers to an inflection, this field <strong>MUST</strong> match the <code>of</code> field of the corresponding inflection record.
                                    Otherwise, this field <strong>MUST NOT</strong> be present.

                                    If left unspecified, the script is assumed to be the same as the lexeme that the record provides an alternate for.

                                    If the pronunciation of the alternate differs from the original lexeme, a hint at its pronunciation.

                            Any two alternate records in a single LDOC <strong>MUST NOT</strong> have identical values for both the <code>alternate</code> and <code>for</code> fields, when both records provide an alternate form for a lexeme, or identical values for all three of the <code>alternate</code>, <code>for</code>, and <code>of</code> fields, when both records provide an alternate form for an inflection.
